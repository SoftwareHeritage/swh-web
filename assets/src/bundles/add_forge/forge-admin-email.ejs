Dear forge administrator,

The mission of Software Heritage is to collect, preserve and share all the
publicly available source code (see https://www.softwareheritage.org for more
information).

We just received a request to add the forge hosted at <%= forgeUrl %> to the
list of software origins that are archived, and it is our understanding that you
are the contact person for this forge.

In order to archive the forge contents, we will have to periodically pull the
public repositories it contains and clone them into the
Software Heritage archive.

Would you be so kind as to reply to this message to acknowledge the reception
of this email and let us know if there are any special steps we should take in
order to properly archive the public repositories hosted on your infrastructure?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Kind regards,
The Software Heritage team
