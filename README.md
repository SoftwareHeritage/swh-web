# swh-web

This repository holds the development of Software Heritage web applications:

* swh-web API (https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api): enables to query the
  content of the archive through HTTP requests and get responses in JSON or
  YAML.

* swh-web browse (https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse): graphical
  interface that eases the navigation in the archive.

Documentation about how to use these components but also the details of their
URI schemes can be found in the docs folder. The produced HTML documentation
can be read and browsed at
https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-web/index.html.

## Technical details

Those applications are powered by:

  * [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) on the backend side
    with the following extensions enabled:

    * [django-rest-framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

    * [django-webpack-loader](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader)

    * [django-js-reverse](http://django-js-reverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  * [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) on the frontend side for better static
    assets management, including:

    * assets dependencies management and retrieval through
      [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

    * linting of custom javascript code (through [eslint](https://eslint.org/))
      and stylesheets (through [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/))

    * use of [es6](http://es6-features.org) syntax and advanced javascript
      feature like [async/await](https://javascript.info/async-await) or
      [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
      thanks to [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (es6 to es5 transpiler and
      polyfills provider)

    * assets minification (using [terser](https://github.com/terser-js/terser)
      and [cssnano](http://cssnano.co/)) but also dead code elimination for
      production use


## How to build, run and test

### Backend requirements

First you will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and a complete [swh
development
environment](https://gitlab.softwareheritage.org/swh/devel/swh-environment)
installed.

To run the backend, you need to have the following [Python 3
modules](requirements.txt) installed.

To run the backend tests, the following [Python 3
modules](requirements-test.txt) are also required to be installed.

One easy way to install them is to use the `pip` tool:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Frontend requirements

To compile the frontend assets, you need to have
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 14.0.0 and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
installed. If you are on Debian, you can easily install an up to date nodejs
from the
[nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md)
repository.

Packages for yarn can be installed by following [these
instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable).
Alternatively, you can install yarn with `npm install yarn`, and add
`YARN=node_modules/yarn/bin/yarn` as argument whenever you run `make`.

Please note that the static assets bundles generated by webpack are not stored
in the git repository. Follow the instructions below in order to generate them
in order to be able to run the frontend part of the web applications.

### Make targets to execute the applications

Below is the list of available make targets that can be executed from the root
directory of swh-web in order to build and/or execute the web applications
under various configurations:

* **run-django-webpack-devserver**: Compile and serve not optimized (without
  mignification and dead code elimination) frontend static assets using
  [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) and run
  django server with development settings. This is the recommended target to
  use when developing swh-web as it enables automatic reloading of backend and
  frontend part of the applications when modifying source files (*.py, *.js,
  *.css, *.html).

* **run-django-webpack-dev**: Compile not optimized (no minification, no dead
  code elimination) frontend static assets using webpack and run django server
  with development settings. This is the recommended target when one only wants
  to develop the backend side of the application.

* **run-django-webpack-prod**: Compile optimized (with minification and dead
  code elimination) frontend static assets using webpack and run django server
  with production settings. This is useful to test the applications in
  production mode (with the difference that static assets are served by
  django). Production settings notably enable advanced django caching and you
  will need to have [memcached](https://memcached.org/) installed for that
  feature to work.

* **run-django-server-dev**: Run the django server with development settings
  but without compiling frontend static assets through webpack.

* **run-django-server-prod**: Run the django server with production settings
  but without compiling frontend static assets through webpack.

* **run-gunicorn-server**: Run the web applications with production settings in
  a [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) worker as they will be in real production
  environment.

Once one of these targets executed, the web applications can be executed by
pointing your browser to http://localhost:5004.

### Make targets to test the applications

Some make targets are also available to easily execute the backend and frontend
tests of the Software Heritage web applications.

The backend tests are powered by the
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and
[hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) frameworks while the
frontend ones rely on the use of the [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) tool.

Below is the exhaustive list of those targets:

* **test**: execute the backend tests using a fast hypothesis profile (only one
  input example will be provided for each test)

* **test-full**: execute the backend tests using a slower hypothesis profile
  (one hundred of input examples will be provided for each test which helps
  spotting possible bugs)

* **test-frontend**: execute the frontend tests using cypress in headless mode
  but with some slow test suites disabled

* **test-frontend-full**: execute the frontend tests using cypress in headless
  mode with all test suites enabled

* **test-frontend-ui**: execute the frontend tests using the cypress GUI but
  with some slow test suites disabled

* **test-frontend-full-ui**: execute the frontend tests using the cypress GUI
  with all test suites enabled

### Yarn targets

Below is a list of available yarn targets in order to only execute the frontend
static assets compilation (no web server will be executed):

* **build-dev**: compile not optimized (without mignification and dead code
  elimination) frontend static assets and store the results in the
  `swh/web/static` folder.

* **build**: compile optimized (with mignification and dead code elimination)
  frontend static assets and store the results in the `swh/web/static` folder.

**The build target must be executed prior performing the Debian packaging of
swh-web** in order for the package to contain the optimized assets dedicated to
production environment.

To execute these targets, issue the following command:

```
$ yarn <target_name>
```
