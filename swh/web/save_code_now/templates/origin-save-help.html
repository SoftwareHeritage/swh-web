    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A "Save code now" request takes the following parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Origin type:</b> the type of version control system the software origin is using.
        Currently, the supported types are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>git</code>, for origins using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>hg</code>, for origins using <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>svn</code>, for origins using <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>
          </li>
          {% if "cvs" in visit_types %}
            <li>
              <code>cvs</code>, for origins using <a href="https://cvs.nongnu.org/">CVS</a>
            </li>
          {% endif %}
          {% if "bzr" in visit_types %}
            <li>
              <code>bzr</code>, for origins using <a href="https://bazaar.canonical.com/en/">Bazaar</a>
            </li>
          {% endif %}
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Origin url:</b> the url of the remote repository for the software origin.
        <br />
        In order to avoid saving errors from Software Heritage, you should provide the clone/checkout url
        as given by the provider hosting the software origin.
        <br />
        It can easily be found in the
        web interface used to browse the software origin.
        <br />
        For instance, if you want to save a <code>git</code>
        origin into the archive, you should check that the command <code>$ git clone &lt;origin_url&gt;</code>
        <br />
        does not return an error before submitting a request.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once submitted, your save request can either be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>accepted:</b> a visit to the provided origin will then be scheduled by Software Heritage in order to
        load its content into the archive as soon as possible
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>rejected:</b> the provided origin url is blacklisted and no visit will be scheduled
      </li>
      <li>
        put in <b>pending</b> state: a manual review will then be performed in order to determine if the
        origin can be safely loaded or not into the archive
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once a save request has been accepted, you can follow its current status in the
      <a id="swh-show-origin-save-requests-list"
         href="{% url 'origin-save-list' %}">submitted save requests list</a>.
      <br />
      If you submitted requests while <a href="{% url login_url %}">authenticated</a>, you will be able
      to only display your own requests.
    </p>
