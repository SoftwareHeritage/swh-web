        Request the saving of a software origin into the archive
        or check the status of previously created save requests.

        That endpoint enables to create a saving task for a software origin
        through a POST request.

        Depending of the provided origin url, the save request can either be:

            * immediately **accepted**, for well known code hosting providers
              like for instance GitHub or GitLab
            * **rejected**, in case the url is blacklisted by Software Heritage
            * **put in pending state** until a manual check is done in order to
              determine if it can be loaded or not

        Once a saving request has been accepted, its associated saving task
        status can then be checked through a GET request on the same url.
        Returned status can either be:

            * **not created**: no saving task has been created
            * **not yet scheduled**: saving task has been created but its
              execution has not yet been scheduled
            * **scheduled**: the task execution has been scheduled
            * **succeeded**: the saving task has been successfully executed
            * **failed**: the saving task has been executed but it failed

        When issuing a POST request an object will be returned while a GET
        request will return an array of objects (as multiple save requests
        might have been submitted for the same origin).

        :param string visit_type: the type of visit to perform
            (currently the supported types are {visit_types})

            request was issued
        :>json string save_request_status: the status of the save request,
            either **accepted**, **rejected** or **pending**
        :>json string save_task_status: the status of the origin saving task,
            either **not created**, **not yet scheduled**, **scheduled**,
            **succeeded** or **failed**
        :>json string visit_date: the date (in iso format) of the visit if a visit
            occurred, null otherwise.
        :>json string visit_status: the status of the visit, either **full**,
            **partial**, **not_found** or **failed** if a visit occurred, null
            otherwise.
