  - title: Welcome to the guided tour !
    intro: |
      This guided tour will showcase Software Heritage web application
      features to help you navigate into the archive.<br/>
      Let's see what we can do from the homepage first.

  - element: .swh-search-box
    title: Search archived software origins
    intro: |
      An origin corresponds to a location from which a coherent set of
      source codes has been obtained, like a git repository, a directory
      containing tarballs, etc.<br/><br/>
      Software origins are identified by URLs (git clone URLs for instance).<br/><br/>
      You can search for terms in the full set of archived software
      origin URLs. You will be redirected to a dedicated interface displaying search
      results. Clicking on an origin URL will then take you to the source code browsing
      interface. If you enter a complete archived origin URL, you will be immediately
      redirected to its source code browsing interface.

  - element: .swh-origin-save-link
    title: Save code now
    intro: |
      If you haven't found the software origin you were looking for, you can use the
      Save Code Now interface to submit a save request that will be immediately processed.

  - element: .swh-vault-link
    title: Downloads from the vault
    intro: |
      Show the list of downloads you requested from the Software Heritage Vault
      while browsing the archive. <br/>
      Those downloads correspond to tarballs containing source directories
      archived by Software Heritage. <br/>
      The list of downloads is stored in your browser local storage so it
      will be persistent across your visits.

  - element: .swh-help-link
    title: Launch guided tour
    intro: Replay the guided tour.

  - element: "#swh-login"
    title: Login or register
    intro: |

      profile interface where you can generate bearer token for Web API
      authentication.

  - element: "#swh-web-api-link"
    title: Software Heritage Web API
    intro: |

      of endpoints and how to use each one with a detailed example.<br/>
      Please note that the Web API can also be queried from your web browser
      through a dedicated HTML interface displaying query results.

  - title: Browsing source code of an archived software origin
    intro: |
      Come on in, let's introduce the Web UI to browse the content of an
      archived software origin.

browseOrigin:
  - title: Browse source code of an archived software origin
    intro: |
      You just arrived into the first view of the archived source code of an origin.
      The displayed source code files are taken from the most recent snapshot taken by
      Software Heritage. By default, the content of the main branch (aka HEAD, master, ...)
      is displayed.
      Continue your journey and dive deeper into the code and its development history.

  - element: "#swh-origin-url"
    title: Software origin URL
    intro: |
      You can find the URL of the archived software origin.<br/>

          <b>content:</b> a (specific version of a) file stored in the archive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>directory:</b> a set of named pointers to contents (file entries), directories
          (directory entries) and revisions (revision entries).
        </li>
        <li>
