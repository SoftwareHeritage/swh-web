Origin
^^^^^^

This describes the URI scheme when one wants to browse the Software Heritage
archive in the context of an origin (for instance, a repository crawled from
GitHub or a Debian source package). All the views pointed by that scheme
offer quick links to browse objects as found during the associated crawls
performed by Software Heritage:

    * the root directory of the origin
    * the list of branches of the origin
    * the list of releases of the origin

Origin visits
"""""""""""""

.. http:get:: /browse/origin/visits/

    HTML view that displays visits reporting for a software origin identified by
    its type and url.

    :query string origin_url: mandatory parameter providing the url of the origin
        (e.g. https://github.com/(user)/(repo))
    :statuscode 200: no error
    :statuscode 400: no origin url has been provided as parameter
    :statuscode 404: requested origin can not be found in the archive

Origin directory
""""""""""""""""

.. http:get:: /browse/origin/directory/

    HTML view for browsing the content of a directory reachable from the root directory
    (including itself) associated to the latest full visit of a software origin.

    The content of the directory is first sorted in lexicographical order
    and the sub-directories are displayed before the regular files.

    The view enables to navigate from the requested directory to
    directories reachable from it in a recursive way but also
    up to the origin root directory.
    A breadcrumb located in the top part of the view allows
    to keep track of the paths navigated so far.

    The view also enables to easily switch between the origin branches
    and releases through a dropdown menu.

    The origin branch (default to HEAD) from which to retrieve the directory
    content can also be specified by using the branch query parameter.

    :query string origin_url: mandatory parameter providing the url of the origin
        (e.g. https://github.com/(user)/(repo))
    :query string path: optional parameter used to specify the path of a directory
        reachable from the origin root one
    :query string branch: specify the origin branch name from which
        to retrieve the root directory
    :query string release: specify the origin release name from which
        to retrieve the root directory
    :query string revision: specify the origin revision, identified by the hexadecimal
        representation of its **sha1_git** value, from which to retrieve the root directory
    :query string timestamp: an ISO 8601 datetime string to parse in order to find the
      closest visit.
    :query int visit_id: specify a visit id to retrieve the directory from instead
        of using the latest full visit by default
    :statuscode 200: no error
    :statuscode 400: no origin url has been provided as parameter

    HTML view that produces a display of revisions history heading

    In other words, it shows the commit log associated to the latest
    full visit of a software origin.

        * link to browse the associated revision in the origin context
        * author of the revision
        * date of the revision
        * message associated the revision
        * commit date of the revision

    By default, the revisions are ordered in reverse chronological order of
    their commit date.

    N log entries are displayed per page (default is 100). In order to navigate
    in a large history, two buttons are present at the bottom of the view:

        * **Newer**: fetch and display if available the N more recent log entries
          than the ones currently displayed
        * **Older**: fetch and display if available the N older log entries
          than the ones currently displayed

.. http:get:: /browse/origin/(origin_url)/log/
   :deprecated:

    .. warning::
       That endpoint is deprecated, use :http:get:`/browse/snapshot/log/` instead.

    HTML view that produces a display of revisions history heading
    to the last revision found during the latest visit of a software origin.
    In other words, it shows the commit log associated to the latest
    full visit of a software origin.

    The following data are displayed for each log entry:

        * link to browse the associated revision in the origin context
        * author of the revision
        * date of the revision
        * message associated the revision
        * commit date of the revision

    By default, the revisions are ordered in reverse chronological order of
    their commit date.

    N log entries are displayed per page (default is 100). In order to navigate
    in a large history, two buttons are present at the bottom of the view:

        * **Newer**: fetch and display if available the N more recent log entries
          than the ones currently displayed
        * **Older**: fetch and display if available the N older log entries
          than the ones currently displayed

    The view also enables to easily switch between the origin branches
    and releases through a dropdown menu.

    The origin branch (default to HEAD) from which to retrieve the content
    can also be specified by using the branch query parameter.

    :query string origin_url: mandatory parameter providing the url of the origin
        (e.g. https://github.com/(user)/(repo))
    :query int per_page: the number of log entries to display per page
    :query int offset: the number of revisions to skip before returning those to display
    :query str revs_ordering: specify the revisions ordering, possible values are ``committer_date``,
        ``dfs``, ``dfs_post`` and ``bfs``
    :query string branch: specify the origin branch name from which
        to retrieve the commit log
    :query string release: specify the origin release name from which
        to retrieve the commit log
    :query string revision: specify the origin revision, identified by the hexadecimal
        representation of its **sha1_git** value, from which to retrieve the commit log
    :query string timestamp: an ISO 8601 datetime string to parse in order to find the
      closest visit.
    :query int visit_id: specify a visit id to retrieve the history log from instead
        of using the latest visit by default
