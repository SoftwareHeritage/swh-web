=======

This repository holds the developement of Software Heritage web applications:

    * SWH Web API (https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api): enables to query 
      the content of the SWH archive through HTTP requests and get responses in JSON or YAML.

    * SWH Web browse (https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse): graphical interface 
      that eases the navigation in the SWH archive.

Those applications are powered by the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

Documentation about how to use these components but also the details of their URI schemes
can be found in the docs folder. The produced HTML documentation can be read and browsed
at https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-web/index.html.
